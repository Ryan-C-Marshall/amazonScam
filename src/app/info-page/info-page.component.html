    <p id="title-paragraph">Don't worry &mdash; this site doesn't store or sell any of your information. Instead, 
      this site's purpose is to educate its users in the hope that they don't fall for 
      similar, more malicious scams. Below is some information you might find useful!</p>
    <app-collapsible-box class="info-box" title="How could I have identified this website as a scam?" [initiallyCollapsed]="true">
      <h3>The Email</h3>
      <p>
        First, the way you navigated here was unorthodox. Amazon doesn't typically send you emails like the
        one that brought you here. A lot of scam emails 'look sketchy', have bad spelling or grammar, and use
        generic terms (like 'Dear user'). Even if the email looks professional, be immediately skeptical of 
        any email (or text) that directs you to a website or claims that immediate action is needed to 
        resolve some emergency or to collect some prize.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ideally, you never even end up on a scam website. By hovering over the hyperlink/button in the email, 
        a small box should appear at the bottom of your browser showing where that link will take you, no 
        matter how they try to hide their site's address. Try it with 
        <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://scam.com">this link</a> now!
      </p>
      <h3>The Url</h3>
      <p>
        Likely the best way of spotting any scam is by this url. A lot of scam urls will try to look similar
        to the real website's url &mdash; like 'amazon-deliveries.com' or 'cibc-mysecurelogin.com' &mdash; 
        but they make compromises like including dashes or mispelling the domain name, because they can't own
        the actual domain. Inspect the url carefully!
      </p>
      <h3>The Site</h3>
      <p>
        If you're still not sure, there are a few ways to tell whether a site is a fake. The easiest (and best)
        tactic is to leave the site, search up your desired website (e.g. amazon), and follow that link. However,
        if you're determined to know whether you're being scammed, take a 'look' around the site. Oftentimes,
        whoever built the site didn't take the time to get things like menu buttons or navigational bars working,
        and put them there only for appearance. Another hint is when your username/password doesn't autofill, as
        this indicates you're on a different website than usual.

    <app-collapsible-box class="info-box" title="Spotting more kinds of scams" [initiallyCollapsed]="true">
      <p>
        This website is a classic example of a phishing scam: a type of scam where the attacker pretends
        to be someone they're not in order to gain your trust, after which they extract sensitive information
        like your login or payment info. Here are some other common scams and how to thwart them.
        <strong>Remember: if it seems too good to be true, it's almost certainly not true.</strong>
      </p>
      <h3>
        Tech Support Scams
      </h3>
      <p>
        Scammers pretend to be tech support from well-known companies, claiming your computer has a virus.
        They ask for remote access to your computer. From here, the script varies, but you'll always,
        eventually, need to pay someone. They often ask for gift cards, as they are untracable.
      </p>
      <p>How to avoid:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Don't trust unsolicited tech support calls or pop-up messages.</li>
        <li>If you need tech support, contact the company directly using their official website.</li>
        <li>Install and regularly update reputable antivirus software.</li>
        <li><strong>Never</strong> buy a gift card as payment for someone online.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Online Shopping Scams</h3>
      <p>
        These involve fake online stores that sell counterfeit products or don't deliver
        the products at all.
      </p>
      <p>How to avoid:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Research the seller and read reviews before purchasing.</li>
        <li>Use secure payment methods like credit cards or trusted payment services.</li>
        <li>Be especially wary of deals that seem too good to be true.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Romance Scams</h3>
      <p>
        Scammers create fake profiles on dating sites and social media to establish romantic
        relationships, eventually asking for money.
      </p>
      <p>How to avoid:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Be cautious with people you meet online, especially if they quickly express strong emotions.</li>
        <li>Never send money or share financial information with someone you haven't met in person.</li>
        <li>Watch for red flags like excuses to avoid meeting in person or requests for financial help.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Lottery or Prize Scams</h3>
      <p>
        You receive a message saying you've won a lottery or prize, but you need to pay fees or provide 
        personal information to claim it.
      </p>
      <p>How to avoid:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Remember, you can't win a lottery you didn't enter.</li>
        <li>Never pay to claim a prize.</li>
        <li>Verify any claims by contacting the organization directly through official channels.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Investment Scams</h3>
      <p>Scammers offer high-return investment opportunities with little or no risk.</p>
      <p>How to avoid:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Be skeptical of unsolicited investment offers.</li>
        <li>Do thorough research and seek advice from a financial advisor.</li>
        <li>Remember the adage: if it sounds too good to be true, it probably is.</li>
      </ul>
